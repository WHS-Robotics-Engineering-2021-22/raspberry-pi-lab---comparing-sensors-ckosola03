The ultarsonic sensor which is a exteroceptive sensor because it reads its enviroment could be used to sense how far away one robots objective is. It could also sense if it is going to run into something. The DHT11 is also an exteroceptive sensor but can also be used as an proprioceptive sensor. You could use it on the robots motors or gearboxes to detect the teperature of them and make sure they dont overheat. The limit switch is a proprioceptive sensor because it consticts/stops the flow of electrons within the circuit. The switch could simply be used to turn the robot on and off or control the flow of elctrons within the robot.
